                <h3>What is Indian Army ??</h3>
                <p>The Indian Army is the land-based branch of the Indian Armed Forces. It is the world's second-largest
                    standing army and the largest army. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian
                    Army, and it is commanded by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two
                    battalions of the Indian Army have been awarded the "Nations in conflict" peacekeeping medal. The
                    Indian Army has a regimental system but is operationally and geographically split into seven
                    commands, with the basic field formation being a division. It is an all-volunteer force and
                    comprises more than 81,000 active troops and a support element of close to 1,160,000 troops.
                </p>
                <p>The Indian Army is a very disciplined force and follows a strict hierarchy. Officers must salute
                    their seniors, regardless of rank, and must obey orders from their superiors without question. The
                    soldiers are also expected to maintain a high degree of personal hygiene and be physically fit.</p>

                <h3>More details about Indian army</h3>
                <p>Indian Army is the third-largest Army in the globe, is one of the most powerful and strongest among
                    the armies of other countries. In the past, they have proved their superiority in different battles
                    and missions that have been conducted. Through this short essay on the Indian Army in English, one
                    will be able to see the power and strength that the Indian Army possesses.


                    The Indian Army has only one goal, which is to safeguard the nation's security and maintain unity in
                    the country. All the recruits in the Army perform to achieve this one goal. The Indian Army consists
                    of a total number of 65 regiments that are classified or divided based on their skills and
                    capabilities. They are trained with two formations that are holding formation and combat formation.
                    Holding formation is meant for defense, and combat formation is meant for an attack.

                    The Indian Army improves its skills by conducting training missions with different powerful
                    countries such as The United States, Russia, and Israel.</p>
